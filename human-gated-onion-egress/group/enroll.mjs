// This is the trust boundary of the whole system: the zk proof gates on
// membership in THIS set, so whatever ceremony adds a commitment here is what
// "human" means. For the PoC, enrollment is a local command. In production this
// leaf would be added only after a proof-of-personhood check (World ID, an
// in-person ceremony, a social-graph attestation, etc.). The cryptography below
// is identical either way; only the admission policy changes.
//
// Usage:
//   node group/enroll.mjs                  -> new identity, prints a client secret
//   node group/enroll.mjs <name>           -> label the member (label is NOT stored in the set)
