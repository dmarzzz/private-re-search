## A key limitation of the BIM 

§ BIM – like much of original IR – was designed for 

titles or abstracts, and not for modern full text 

search 

§ We want to pay attention to term frequency and 

document lengths, just like in other models we 

discuss 

§ Want 

§ Want some model of how often terms occur in docs

## 1. Okapi BM25 [Robertson et al. 1994, TREC City U.] 

§ BM25 “Best Match 25” (they had a bunch of tries!) 

§ Developed in the context of the Okapi system 

§ Started to be increasingly adopted by other teams during 

the TREC competitions 

§ It works well 

§ Goal: be sensitive to term frequency and document 

length while not adding too many parameters 

§ (Robertson and Zaragoza 2009; Spärck Jones et al. 2000) Introduction to Information Retrieval

## Poisson distribution 

§ The Poisson distribution models the probability of k, 

the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of 

time/space, with known average rate λ ( = cf /T), 

independent of the last event 

§ Examples 

§ Number of cars arriving at the toll booth per minute 

§ Number of typos on a page 

p(k) =

λk

k! e−

> λ

Introduction to Information Retrieval 

## Poisson distribution 

§ If T is large and p is small, we can approximate a 

binomial distribution with a Poisson where λ = Tp 

§ Mean = Variance = λ = Tp. 

§ Example p = 0.08, T = 20. Chance of 1 occurrence is: 

§ Binomial 

§ Poisson … already close 

p(k) =

## Poisson model 

§ Assume that term frequencies in a document ( tf i)

follow a Poisson distribution 

§ “Fixed interval” implies fixed document length … 

think roughly constant -sized document abstracts

## Eliteness (“ aboutness ”) 

§ Model term frequencies using eliteness 

§ What is eliteness ?

§ Hidden variable for each document -term pair, 

denoted as Ei for term i

§ Represents aboutness : a term is elite in a 

document if, in some sense, the document is 

about the concept denoted by the term 

§ Eliteness is binary 

§ Term occurrences depend only on eliteness… 

§ … but eliteness depends on relevance Introduction to Information Retrieval 

## Elite terms 

Text from the Wikipedia page on the NFL draft showing 

elite terms 

The National Football League Draft 

is an annual event in which the 

National Football League (NFL )

teams select eligible college 

football players . It serves as the 

league’s most common source of 

player recruitment . The basic design 

of the draft is that each team is given 

a position in the draft order in 

reverse order relative to its record …Introduction to Information Retrieval 

## Graphical model with eliteness

Binary 

variables Introduction to Information Retrieval 

## Retrieval Status Value 

§ Similar to the BIM derivation, we have 

where 

and using eliteness, we have: 

RSV elite = ci 

> elite
> i∈q,tfi>0

## ∑ (tfi );

p(TFi = tfi R) = p(TFi = tfi Ei = elite)p(Ei = elite R)

+ p(TFi = tfi Ei = elite)(1− p(Ei = elite R))

ci 

> elite

(tfi ) = log p(TFi = tfi R = 1)p(TFi = 0 R = 0)

p(TFi = 0 R = 1)p(TFi = tfi R = 0)Introduction to Information Retrieval 

## 2-Poisson model 

§ The problems with the 1 -Poisson model suggests 

fitting two Poisson distributions 

§ In the “2 -Poisson model”, the distribution is different 

depending on whether the term is elite or not 

§ where π is probability that document is elite for term 

§ but, unfortunately, we don’t know π, λ, μ 

## p(TFi = ki R) =Introduction to Information Retrieval 

Let’s get an idea: Graphing for 

different parameter values of the 2 -Poisson

## Qualitative properties 

§

§ increases monotonically with tf i

§ … but asymptotically approaches a maximum value 

as [not true for simple scaling of tf ]

§ … with the asymptotic limit being

## Approximating the saturation function 

§ Estimating parameters for the 2 -Poisson model is not 

easy 

§ … So approximate it with a simple parametric curve 

that has the same qualitative properties 

## tf

## k1 + tfIntroduction to Information Retrieval 

## Saturation function 

§ For high values of k1, increments in tf i continue to 

contribute significantly to the score 

§ Contributions tail off quickly for low values of k1Introduction to Information Retrieval 

## “Early” versions of BM25 

§ Version 1: using the saturation function 

§ Version 2: BIM simplification to IDF 

§ (k1+1) factor doesn’t change ranking, but makes 

term score 1 when tf i = 1

§ Similar to tf -idf , but term scores are bounded

## Document length normalization 

§ Longer documents are likely to have larger tf i values 

§ Why might documents be longer? 

§ Verbosity: suggests observed tf i too high 

§ Larger scope: suggests observed tf i may be right 

§ A real document collection probably has both effects 

§ … so should apply some kind of partial normalization Introduction to Information Retrieval 

## Document length normalization 

§ Document length: 

§ avdl : Average document length over collection 

§ Length normalization component 

§ b = 1 full document length normalization 

§ b = 0 no document length normalization

## Okapi BM25 

§ k1 controls term frequency scaling 

§ k1 = 0 is binary model; k1 large is raw term frequency 

§ b controls document length normalization 

§ b = 0 is no length normalization; b = 1 is relative 

frequency (fully scale by document length) 

§ Typically, k1 is set around 1.2 –2 and b around 0.75 

§ IIR sec. 11.4.3 discusses incorporating query term 

weighting and (pseudo) relevance feedback

## Why is BM25 better than VSM tf -idf? 

§ Suppose your query is [machine learning] 

§ Suppose you have 2 documents with term counts: 

§ doc1: learning 1024; machine 1 

§ doc2: learning 16; machine 8 

§ tf -idf: log 2 tf * log 2 (N/ df )

§ doc1: 11 * 7 + 1 * 10 = 87 

§ doc2: 5 * 7 + 4 * 10 = 75 

§ BM25: k1 = 2 

§ doc1: 7 * 3 + 10 * 1 = 31 

§ doc2: 7 * 2.67 + 10 * 2.4 = 42.7 Introduction to Information Retrieval 

## 2. Ranking with features 

§ Textual features 

§ Zones: Title, author, abstract, body, anchors, … 

§ Proximity 

§ …

§ Non -textual features 

§ File type 

§ File age 

§ Page rank 

§ …Introduction to Information Retrieval 

## Ranking with zones 

§ Straightforward idea: 

§ Apply your favorite ranking function (BM25) to 

each zone separately 

§ Combine zone scores using a weighted linear 

combination 

§ But that seems to imply that the eliteness properties 

of different zones are different and independent of 

each other 

§ …which seems unreasonable Introduction to Information Retrieval 

## Ranking with zones 

§ Alternate idea 

§ Assume eliteness is a term/document property 

shared across zones 

§ … but the relationship between eliteness and term 

frequencies are zone -dependent  

> §e.g., denser use of elite topic words in title

§ Consequence 

§ First combine evidence across zones for each term 

§ Then combine evidence across terms Introduction to Information Retrieval 

## BM25F with zones 

§ Calculate a weighted variant of total term frequency 

§ … and a weighted variant of document length 

where 

vz is zone weight 

tf zi is term frequency in zone z

len z is length of zone z

Z is the number of zones 

tfi = vztfzi

> z=1
> Z

## ∑ dl = vzlenz

> z=1
> Z

## ∑ avdl = Average

documents

## Simple BM25F with zones 

§ Simple interpretation: zone z is “replicated” vz times 

§ But we may want zone -specific parameters ( k1, b, 

IDF)

## Ranking with non -textual features 

§ Assumptions 

§ Usual independence assumption 

§ Independent of each other and of the textual features 

§ Allows us to factor out in BIM -style 

derivation 

§ Relevance information is query independent 

§ Usually true for features like page rank, age, type, … 

§ Allows us to keep all non -textual features in the BIM -

style derivation where we drop non -query terms

## Interpret Clicks: an Example 

§ Clicks are good… 

§ Are these two clicks 

equally “good ”?

§ Non -clicks may have 

excuses: 

§ Not relevant 

§ Not examined

§ Higher positions receive 

more user attention (eye 

fixation) and clicks than 

lower positions. 

§ This is true even in the 

extreme setting where 

the order of positions is 

reversed .

## User behavior 

§ User behavior is an intriguing source of relevance data 

§ Users make (somewhat) informed choices when 

they interact with search engines 

§ Potentially a lot of data available in search logs 

§ But there are significant caveats 

§ User behavior data can be very noisy 

§ Interpreting user behavior can be tricky 

§ Spam can be a significant problem 

§ Not all queries will have user behavior Introduction to Information Retrieval 

## Features based on user behavior 

From [ Agichtein , Brill, Dumais 2006; Joachims 2002] 

§ Click -through features 

§ Click frequency, click probability, click deviation 

§ Click on next result? previous result? above? below>? 

§ Browsing features 

§ Cumulative and average time on page, on domain, on URL 

prefix; deviation from average times 

§ Browse path features 

§ Query -text features 

§ Query overlap with title, snippet, URL, domain, next query 

§ Query length Introduction to Information Retrieval 

## Incorporating user behavior into 

## ranking algorithm 

§ Incorporate user behavior features into a ranking 

function like BM25F 

§ But requires an understanding of user behavior 

features so that appropriate Vj functions are used 

§ Incorporate user behavior features into learned 

ranking function 

§ Either of these ways of incorporating user behavior 

signals improve ranking Introduction to Information Retrieval
